# Skiathlon
Programmed in Verilog on a Basys3 board
This lab introduces using the VGA screen to output a display from our basys3 board. The VGA port is controlled by the Hsync, Vsync and the RGB signals. The Hsync and Vsync oversees outputting the actual display and the RGB signals will color the screen when given a range of Hsync and Vsync signals. This lab is unique because we have to create frames and output colors based on the counters of our Hsyncs and Vsyncs. The screen we are outputting is 800x525 pixel grid. The actual display is 640x480 which is labeled as the active region. The product of this lab is a ski game where we have a randomly generated gate that the player as to go through without crashing. The main difficulty of this lab are the randomly generated gates and the overall debugging process of this lab as we cannot simulate this lab because of how long it takes to generate a single frame. The monitor is generating the frames 60 times a second, so a simulation of the game would take ages.
